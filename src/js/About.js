        Recently, I have enrolled in flight school. It has always been a dream of mine to own and fly my own personal airplane. I enjoy the responsibility that comes with being a pilot. The training is strict but once we are up in the air its smooth sailing for me!

        Here is a picture of me at our company costume contest while I was working at Firespring. I always get excited for events like this. Where I can connect with my team members and get to know them on a personal level.
